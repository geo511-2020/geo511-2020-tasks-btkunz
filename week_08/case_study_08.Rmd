## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r eval = T, message = F, warning = F, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
library(ggplot2)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)

 co2 <- read_table("sneed.txt", skip = 56)%>%
   dplyr::select(year, mean)
  
 co2_plot <- ggplot(co2, aes(year, mean))+
 geom_line()+
 labs(x = "year",
      y = "Mean CO2 level",
      title = "time series of CO2 levels through time")
 plot(co2_plot)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r eval = T, message = F, warning = F, echo = FALSE}
library(magick)
co2 %>% 
  top_n(5) %>% 
  arrange(desc(year))%>%
  kable(align = "ll", caption = "Top 5 Annual Mean Carbon Dioxide Concentrations")  
     #Help from Zixuan and Dr. Wilson
  #row_spec(1, bold = T, color ="blue")%>% 
  #as_image(width = 10, file = "table.png")
  
#  x <- knitr::kable(head(co2), "html")
#row_spec(x, 1, bold = TRUE, italic = TRUE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
